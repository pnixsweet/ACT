Welcome to the introduction of ACT course. I'm your instructor Eric.  Here's some my background might intrigue you. I graduated from University of Washington, Seattle with a Bachelor of Science in Biologicial science with a minor in Applied Math and another minor in Music - becuase i like classical music and me, myself play classical guitar. I was, and still, yes, a member of Seattle Classical Guitar Society and played dual with our department chair Professor David Baker who is one of the best Biochemist in this wrold i believe. He is real popular and on the science news evereywhere. I also have a master degree in bioinformatics from Northeastern University. Prior to relocate back to Shanghai, I was a research bioinformatics scientist at Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle. Besides research and classical music, i like outdoor sports: hiking, kayaking, camping and snow-boarding. Yeah, unfortunately, there are not too many this kind of activities here in China. 

Please find the course supporting materials on this course site. At meantime, i'm working on my own canvas page so hopefully it could be up by next wednesday. Otherwise, we could stick with this course page if you feel like this works better.

Normally, i would update and upload the materials for the class ahead of time so that you could fully use your free time to study ACT on your own pace. 

Do make sure you would finish your assignment on time and bring questions and thoughts to the class period. 

Here's the Syllabus and covered topics for you. And i will post the anouncement and daily assignment on the course Wiki.
